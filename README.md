# music-chart
This is a project to gather top music data from different streaming platforms everyday using python webscraping.
Then at the end of the week the data collected is used to form a single dataset, this process is done using positional average.
After getting the combined dataset for each platform a combined dataset for all the platform is gotten through the same process.
When the final dataset is gotten it is pushed to an API for easy accessibility.
Note: All the process mentioned above is automated using bash scripting
